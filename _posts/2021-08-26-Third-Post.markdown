# Future Plans

Crossed quite a few things off the list from last week. This is great progress. Not sure which ones will be prioritized
right away for next week but these are the current plans.
* ~~Character select screen in main menu~~
* ~~Level select screen for host~~
  * ~~Also, more level besides just big fans~~

The next few features planned (in no particular order) for the project include:
* Auto end a round when all players have finished (instead of waiting for timeout)
* Improvement to character controller
  * Knocking the character prone/rag-doll
  * Slippery ground to slide across
  * Bouncy surfaces and objects to jump off
  * More debugging of jumping and falling mechanics
* Score screen to show player scores at the end of round

Have a great week
