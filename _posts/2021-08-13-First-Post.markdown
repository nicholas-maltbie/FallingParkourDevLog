Hello world, this is the initial post for the Falling Parkour game that me and my friends have been developing. This project is an attempt to re-create the game [Fall Guys](https://fallguys.com/) on a much smaller scale to learn more about multiplayer game development for fun. This blog will have weekly updates as well as informational posts. I may post some of the project updates on my personal blog [nickmaltbie.com](https://nickmaltbie.com) as well but I'll include a link from this blog as well if they relate to the this project as well. 

I've been working on this project for about a year and a half starting as a small project with friends learning how unity's [Data Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS)](https://unity.com/dots) works. There are multiple other project repositories that were transformed into the current [Falling Parkour](https://github.com/nicholas-maltbie/FallingParkour) game you see now. 
* Original DOTS project making PropHunt- [https://github.com/nicholas-maltbie/PropHunt](https://github.com/nicholas-maltbie/PropHunt)
* Making PropHunt using [Mirror Networking](https://mirror-networking.com/) instead of DOTS - [https://github.com/nicholas-maltbie/PropHunt-Mirror](https://github.com/nicholas-maltbie/PropHunt-Mirror)

I started learning about Unity and 3d modeling back in my freshman year of college and have a very old project that I called Treachery (based off Betrayal at House on the Hill) which used the old [UNet framework](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNet.html) from Unity. This project hasn't been touched for a while but has a repository [https://github.com/nicholas-maltbie/Treachery](https://github.com/nicholas-maltbie/Treachery) and an old blog post I wrote about it [Treachery Project Blog Post](https://nickmaltbie.com/honors/2017/07/28/Treachery.html). I kept up a development log while developing the PropHunt DOTS project before I switched to using mirror networking [PropHunt Dev Log](https://nickmaltbie.com/PropHuntDevLog/). Wish I had kept up that old blog, it's fun to read through those old posts but time is always a scarce resource. 

By trade, I'm a software engineer and have recently graduated and moved as part of my job. I won't have as much time to work on the project as I did over the past year when I was a student. I still hope to keep adding small new features to this project and hopefully I will be able to draft the help of a few friends along the way. One of the major resources the PropHunt project switched from DOTS to Mirror is because the [Entity Component System (ECS)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@0.17/manual/index.html) in DOTS was difficult to understand for new programmers and it was easier to encourage them to work on the project without having to understand the complex framework.
