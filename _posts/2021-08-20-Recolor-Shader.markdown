Hello, this post will go through an example project discussing how the Recolor Shader works as of 08-20-21. This post
will go through a simple progression of each part of the shader and how it works. There is an accompanying GitHub
project [Recolor-Shader-Example](https://github.com/nicholas-maltbie/Recolor-Shader-Example) that will be used for this
tutorial. Feel free to download the repo and follow along in the steps. 

You can view the shader graph in the [Falling Parkour Project](https://github.com/nicholas-maltbie/FallingParkour) at
`Assets/Shaders/Recolor/Recolor.shadergraph`.

This post is from the same week as the [Spectators update Post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-08-20-Second-Post %}), 
If you're interested, you should give the update post a read to learn more about the current progress.
