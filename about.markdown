This is a website about the development log of the project [FallingParkour](https://github.com/nicholas-maltbie/FallingParkour).

This project is an offshoot from the other [PropHunt-Mirror](https://github.com/nicholas-maltbie/PropHunt-Mirror) game that me and my friend started working on last year. 

FallingParkour is a game based on [Fall Guys](https://fallguys.com/) where players will run through an obstacle course to compete to be the first. We wanted to change the platforming to be a bit more similar to a traditional platforming game with smoother physics and less rolling around on the ground.

This is a project using [Mirror Networking](https://mirror-networking.com/) to create a simple multiplayer racing game.
